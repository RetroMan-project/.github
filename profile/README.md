# RetroMan
This project is still under contruction, any help is appreciated, see below.

RetroMan is a ROMs manager project that helps you to manage your roms library and sync it with your devices.
This super hero software aims to be the only solution when comes to manage your roms.

## Planned features
- Multi device support: aims to support all the devices on the market, either they are devices or softwares like Miyoo devices, Anbernic Devices, RetroDECK, Batocera, RetroPie (custom device managements as yml templates with their own rules)
- Scraping support
- RetroAchievements support
- Decide which ROMs you want to syncronize on which device with various protocols (local copy, s/ftp, smb)
- Saves backup
- It knows which system are supported or available on the device (supported = surely working, available = emulator is available but may not be really playable)
- Duplicates management
- CLI support

## Nice to have:
- Saves sync between devices if supported, or enforced
- ARCADE romsets support
- Collection support (move collections in and over)
- Format conversions (chd for example)
- m3u generation
- folder as a file support
- cloud storage support
- webserver
- ROMtation

## ROMtation:
A ROM rortation system: when you got a limited memory on your device the ROMtation can be enabled, if enabled it removes the oldest/unused ROMs to make space to the new ones.
